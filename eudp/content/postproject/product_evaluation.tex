\section{Product evaluation}
%You need to evaluate all elements that are part of the project (mechanics, electronics, software and documentation) and ask yourself if the customer received the product he wanted or an even better product. Finally, you should make a conclusion.
Due to a limited development time the product was not completed, according to the requirements. The different requirements are listed below together with an status and a short description.
\\\textbf{Status options:}
\\ X : requirement implemented and tested.
\\ / : Part of the requirement has been implemented and tested.
\\ None, requirement not implemented.

\end{table}

\subsection{Mechanics}
The interface buttons and LEDs is used on the Spartan 6 board, but the housing and cabinet for the system has not been made. This mean that the requirement for water resistant has not been fulfilled
\subsection{Hardware}
Requirement implemented: Shall be able to communicate with a connected module through power line.
\subsection{Digital}
The requirement about the LPC2478 interfacing with an FPGA through the external memory controller has been fulfilled and it is working properly. Also the requirement about using wishbone standards between the blocks inside the Spartan 6 has been fulfilled. The analogue to digital converter in VHDL has not been made according to limited development time.
\subsection{Software}
asd
\subsection{Web}
The requirements regarding the user interface application were fulfilled except warning are not send to the administrator in case of error occurrence. This requirement was not fulfilled since a SMTP server is needed to accomplish the email sending functionality in PHP. In a working product a server could be implemented or even an existent server can be used to manage the send of warning to the administrator.
\subsection{Conclusion}
The limited development time has affected the final product, the necessary requirements were not fulfilled in order for the product to be delivered to the costumer.
