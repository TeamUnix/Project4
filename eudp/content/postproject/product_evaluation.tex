\section{Product evaluation}
%You need to evaluate all elements that are part of the project (mechanics, electronics, software and documentation) and ask yourself if the customer received the product he wanted or an even better product. Finally, you should make a conclusion.
Due to a limited development time the product was not completed, according to the requirements. The different part of the product is and the requirements fulfilled is listed below.
\subsection{Mechanics}
The interface buttons and LEDs is used on the Spartan 6 board, but the housing and cabinet for the system has not been made. This mean that the requirement for water resistant has not been fulfilled
\subsection{Hardware}

\subsection{Digital}
The requirement about the LPC2478 interfacing with an FPGA through the external memory controller has been fulfilled and it is working properly. Also the requirement about using wishbone standards between the blocks inside the Spartan 6 has been fulfilled. The analog to digital converter in VHDL has not been made according to limited development time.
\subsection{Software}

\subsection{Web}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Clearly the limited development time has affected that the product could not be made to fulfil the necessary requirements in order to be delivered to the costumer.
