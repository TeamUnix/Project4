\section{Project evaluation}
The questions below were prepared as a checklist and answered together within the team.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Did you choose the most suitable use of EUDP tools for the project? Which tools were used and which were satisfactory?}\\
		As part of a learning curve, all tools provided by the EUDP method were used, in order to gain broad knowledge on how to use the EUDP as a working process.
\item \textit{Was the project finished on time?}\\
		According to limited development time beside the study and course time, the project was not finished on time. The missing knowledge about the EDUP phases has also affected the work done in the project.
\item \textit{Did you use new (to you) methods?}\\
		All the four phases of the EUDP method was used for the first time. The realisation phase was handle the best. But the understanding of the different phases was not that good when they where used, but a grater understanding of the different phases and what to do in then has been gathered through this project. This method will be used with our new knowledge in the next project.
\item \textit{What do you think needs to be changed in your next project compared to this project?}\\
		The launch phase has to be written more complete according to the EUDP philosophy.
\item \textit{Are you satisfied with the project as a whole?} \\
		The project was satisfactory due to the knowledge acquired by the EUDP working process methods.
