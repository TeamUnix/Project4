\subsubsection{Work to be done in this time box}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Power switch
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Schematic
		\item Printed circuit board
		\item Mount component
		\item Test board
	\end{itemize}
	\item Host controller
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Master wishbone
		\item CPU interface
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Description:}
\begin{description}
	\item[Power switch] A single switch port board for the power switch has to be made, as an essential part for the power switch
	\item[Host controller] is made in the FPGA, and is responsible for the communication between the Spartan6 and the ARM7, it shall be made with wishbone master interface
