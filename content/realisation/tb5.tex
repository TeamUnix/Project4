\lineparagraph{Power switch control}
One of the problems found on the first prototype was that the LTC4357 device don't have a control pin to turn the MOSFETs on/off, this device will work only as an ideal diode, making it a good application for photovoltaic harvesting method.
In contact with Linear Technologies a new device was suggested, the LTC4365, this device is a N-Channel MOSFET controller that protects the load using a higher and lower threshold voltage which can shut-down the supply and a shut-down pin drives the MOSFET gate high or low.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/ltc4365.png}
		\caption{LTC4365 application notes.}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
In this application the shut-down pin is always high which makes the device open the MOSFETS if Vin is between the under voltage and over voltage threshold voltage.

Is necessary to define the over and under voltage threshold, this is found in the common requirements.\\
\\
Common requirements:\\\\
$V_{in} = 30V$ \\
$Offset = \pm 10\% $\\
\\
From the datasheet:\\\\
$ I_{UV} = 10nA $ \\
$ V_{OS} = 3mV $\\
\\
$V_{OSUV}$:maximum tolerable offset (error)\\
$I_{UV}$:worst case scenario current leakage.\\
\\
Under voltage requirement:\\\\
$ U_V=30V-(30*10\%)=27V $\\
\\
Over voltage requirement:\\\\
$ O_V=30V+(30*10\%)=33V $\\
\\
For working conditions of the device the bellow equation have to be true:\\\\
$ R_3+R_4=\frac{V_{OSUV}}{I_{UV}} $\\
\\
Using the formulas given in the datasheet to calculate the value of the 2 resistive dividers:\\\\
$ R_2 = 2*\frac{3mV}{10nA}*(27V-0.5V) = 15.9M\Omega $ Approximate 16M $\Omega $\\ 
\\
$ R_4 = \frac{\frac{V_{OSIU}}{I{UV}}+R_3}{2*O_V} = 246.97k\Omega $ Approximate 250k $\Omega $\\ 
\\
$ R_3 = \frac{V_{OSUV}}{I_{UV}}-R_1 = 50k\Omega $\\
\\
%
\lineparagraph{Simulations}
Linear Technologies have a simulator for them devices, the LTSpiceIV, is a free software that can be downloaded from the web site.
Using LTSpice to simulate the behaviour of the LTC4365 with the required values for the power switch system.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/tb5_LTC_simu1.png}
		\caption{Schematics for the device LTC4365}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%
In the schematics a basic circuit is draw taken from the datasheet of the device, with a NPN transistor to drive the shut-down pin high and low. Two N-channel MOSFETs are connected back to back to  stop the voltage from passing to the load when the device is shut down. The system will work as power switching and ideal diode.
%
\lineparagraph{Case Scenario 1 ( Producer device connected to the MODULE side )}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/tb5_LTC_case1.png}
		\caption{Simulation case scenario 1}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
In this case scenario the under voltage and over voltage can be tested along with the shut down pin. The simulation has a total time of 250ms, the system takes 10ms to stabilized at 30V which will stabilize the device at that voltage. At 65ms the NPN transistor is high, driven the input voltage to the shut down pin, with the shut down pin high the device will drive the gates for the two MOSFETs high and the current will flow through the MOSFETs from MODULE to POWERLINE as expected. 
The voltage at the module at 80ms is changed to 24V, this will test the under voltage threshold value. From the calculations made in the analysis section, the device should sink the gates to ground when the voltage is under 27V, this happens with success at 75ms as it can be seen in the simulation above.
To simulate over voltage protection, the MODULE (source) is set to 30V so the device can stabilize again. At 140ms the voltage is pull up to 40V, which the device should sink the gates of the MOSFETs when the voltage is 33V, this happens with success at 142ms.
To test the control of the shut down pin, the voltage on the source side is set to 30V, getting the device to stabilize again. With the device in working conditions the NPN transistor is turned off at 220ms, the shut down pin is then pull down by a 10k$ \Omega $ resistor.\\
%
\lineparagraph{Case Scenario 2 ( Device off, no energy flow from MODULE to POWELINE and the other way around )}
In the case scenario 1, there is no energy flowing when the device is off, is necessary now to simulate if the device is working as a diode, if no energy flows in the opposite direction. In this simulation the source and load positions are changed.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Case 2 Schematics changed}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/tb5_LTC_simu2sc.png}
		\caption{Schematics for the device LTC4365 with Case scenario 2 specifications}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%
Being now the POWERLINE the source and the MODULE the load, this situation can occurs when a battery is fully charged and there is a different potential higher on the POWERLINE side. The device is going to insure that no energy flows in the opposite direction. This is successfully shown in the simulation bellow.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Case 2 Simulation}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/tb5_LTC_simu2.png}
		\caption{Simulation for case scenario 2}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%
The voltage at the source (POWERLINE) is kept at 30V, and at the load (MODULE) the voltage is around 0V (1mV), in this configuration the circuit is behaving as expected. When the device is off, and the energy flow in the opposite direction the system behave as a diode.
%
\lineparagraph{Current Sensors}	
%
Being part of a green energy system, a current sensor is implemented in this power switch system. The measurement of current allows the system to calculate the efficiency of each module connected to the switch port. The current measurements are shown to the user on the web interface.
%
The sensor used is a hall effect linear current sensor from Allegro, the ACS756SCA-050B, a bidirectional hall effect sensor with range from -50A to +50A.
%
\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/current_sensor.png}
		\caption{ACS756SCA Typical application}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%
A test for this device is set on a bread board, the measurements are made using a voltmeter on the output pin. At a temperature of $ 24^\circ C $ the output increments approximated 40mV for each ampere this can be matched with the datasheet. Since we can have a meaningful measure with the factory ranges, theres is no need to amplify the signal.

The redesign of the power switch system required some more analysis since this is the main functionality of the energy hub. 
\lineparagraph{Power Switch Overview}
An overview of the system to be can be seen bellow.
%
\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{ACS756SCA-050 pins.}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
%
In this block diagram the connection between the different modules can be seen. The ARM7 controls the input and output pins of the power switch system, a device driver will be implemented for this functionality later on this project. 
The CS\_OUTPUT corresponds to the current sensor voltage output that goes from 0V(-50A) to 5V(50A), this is connected to one of the 8 ADCs implemented on the FPGA and retrieved to the core system (ARM7) through the EMC (External Memory Control) implementation.
POWERLINE pin form all power switch systems are connected to the same track into the PLC module. This will work as a sniffer fro new communication arriving and to send communication to the modules connected to the energy hub.
The module pin will is a connector for each module, in this prototype 4 ports are built, since there's no more than 4 modules in development.
%
\lineparagraph{Schematics}
Schematics of the power switch system bellow.

	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
In this schematics the current sensor is add to the system a long with the new LTC4365 devices to control the two back to back N-channel MOSFETs. A NPN transistor is added between the $ V_{in} $ and the shut down pin, this will drive the pin to the input voltage or connect to ground, in case off power failure the power switch systems are disconnected since the shut down pin is pull down to ground through a 10K$ \Omega $ resistor.
\lineparagraph{PCB layout}
A layout is made using Altium Designer software version 10. This layout is a prototype so the components have more space between them for easier debugging and changes if necessary.

\subsection{Interrupt register - Theis}
The interrupt register is made to tune performance by limiting the number of read statements the ARM7 is doing, in order to read from the Spartan 6. The interrupt register is not by itself fulfilling any requirements, but it is tuning the following: \textit{NF-1.5}\footnote{Requirement is found in table 3.2 in EPRO 3 project energy-hub} and \textit{B-3}\footnote{Requirement is found in table 3.4 in EPRO 3 project energy-hub}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Analysis}
The purpose of the interrupt register is to limiting the number of readings the ARM7 is making from the Spartan 6. There is one interrupt pin routed from the AMR7 to the Spartan 6, but there is two blocks in the Spartan 6 that makes data for the ARM7. These blocks are the switch input block and the analog to digital converter\footnote{ADC} block. One way to use the interrupt is to allow the switch block to interrupt when a user interact with the system, and then read the ADC with a specific time interval. But to avoid to many unnecessary readings of the ADC, the interrupt register is the only block that is allow to interrupt the ARM7, the interrupt register gets interrupt signals from the ADC and the switch blocks, the register is arranging the interrupt, and when the ARM7 is interrupted, it reads data from the register to find out which block it should read.

		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/tb5_modules_design.png}
		\caption{Module design with IRQ register}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
When a block sends an interrupt to the IRQ\footnote{Interrupt Request} register, it locates the interrupt and put the address to the block on to a FIFO\footnote{First In First Out}, and sends an interrupt to the ARM7, then the AMR7 read the FIFO to get the address on the interrupting block, in that way the ARM7 knows where to read next.

\subsubsection{Design}
The purpose of the interrupt register is to make interrupt functionality on several block with only one interrupt pin to the ARM7. The interrupt register shall be optimized to wishbone use. The interrupt register without wishbone has to inputs, a vector of size N\footnote{N = number of blocks that is allow to interrupt} and an array that is N bit high and AddrRange\footnote{Wishbone address range} bit wide. The output is the IRQ pin to the ARM7 and a data vector equal to the wishbone data width. This is shown in the figure below.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/tb5_irq_reg_nowb.png}
		\caption{IRQ register without wishbone}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
When a block needs to make an interrupt, it puts the wishbone address onto the input array to the IRQ register, and then sets the interrupt output high to tell the IRQ register that there is a valid address that needs to be read. The IRQ register save the address and interrupt the ARM7. When an interrupt occurs on the ARM7, it read the IRQ register to get the address that it shall read next, in this way it takes two wishbone read cycles for the ARM7 to get the right data, but the ARM7 is only reading if the Spartan 6 have valid data to read, instead of make reading with specific interval. The IRQ register save the interrupt in a FIFO in case interrupt is made faster than the ARM7 can read.\\
\paragraph{Interrupt output}
The interrupt output is set low as long a the FIFO is not empty, to tell the ARM7 to keep on reading till the FIFO is empty and sets the IRQ high again.
\paragraph{Data output}
The data output is equal to the wishbone data width, in this case it is 16 bit, and the address is 7 bit. The seven lowest data bits is used for the address to the block that sends the interrupt, the rest of the bits can be used for extra data from the IRQ register.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
A block diagram for the interrupt register is shown below. It consist of three block for handling the interrupt, a input block which handled the input and write data to the FIFO. The FIFO act like memory for the interrupt data, and sends a interrupt to the ARM7. The output block takes input from the wishbone and handle the data to the wishbone, form the FIFO.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/irq_reg_block_dia.png}
		\caption{Block diagram for the IRQ register}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{FIFO - First In First Out}
The FIFO buffer is where the interrupt data is stored before they a read. The input block write data into it, and the output block read data out of it. The FIFO is necessary if the Spartan6 make interrupt faster than the ARM7 can read them. The figure below shows how the First In First Out principle is working.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/tb5_fifo.png}
		\caption{Conceptual diagram of a FIFO buffer}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
The FIFO buffer code is from the book \textit{FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples - Listing 4.20}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
--=====================================
------------- CODE HERE ---------------
--=====================================
...
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{IRQ input}
The input block gets data and interrupt input from every block with interrupt permissions in the system. The purpose of the block is to handle which block is interrupting and which data that have to be written to the FIFO in order to be handle by the ARM7 in the right way. Below the state diagram of the input block is shown. The purpose of a state digram is to make the coding easier.\\
When in IDLE the FIFO write is set low, the interrupt inputs is check, if non of them is high the interrupt counter is set low, to enable new interrupts. If a interrupt is high the state is change to IRQx, where the data output to the FIFO is set to the data from the interrupting source, after that is checks if it is the first time this data is written to the FIFO, if that is the case, the data is written to the FIFO and the returns to IDLE. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
		%\missingfigure{Updated timebox figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/tb5_irq_input_state.png}
		\caption{State diagram for input}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
In the code below the states are defined, this is easily done from the state diagram, the signals that can have the different states a value is also defined here.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
	--Types
	type state_type is	(
								IDLE,
								IRQ1,
								IRQ1_W,
								IRQ2,
								IRQ2_W
								);
	--Signals
	signal state_reg		: state_type;
	signal state_next		: state_type;
	signal irq_1				: std_logic		:=	'0';
	signal irq_2				: std_logic		:=	'0';
...
\end{lstlisting}
This code is where the states are set, if reset is active the state is set to IDLE else the state is set to state\_next.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
	-- state register
	process(Clk, Reset)
	begin
		if	(reset = '1') then
			state_reg		<= IDLE;
		elsif (Clk'event and Clk='1') then
			state_reg		<= state_next;
		end if;
	end process;
...
\end{lstlisting}
This is the part of the code where the state digram is implemented. A case statement is made with the state value as input. First the IDLE state is defined, here wr is set low, then it check if there is a interrupt, if that is the case then it sets the state to IRQx which sets the data and then check if it is first time the data is written else it just sets the state to IDLE, if it is first time the state is set to IRQx\_W where it write the data into the FIFO.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
	-- next state/output logic
	process(state_reg, irq_i, add_1, add_2, full, irq_1, irq_2)
	begin
		state_next		<= state_reg;
		--wr					<= '0';
		case state_reg is
		-- Idle state -------------------------------------------
			when IDLE =>
				wr		<= '0';
				if(irq_i(0) = '1') then
					state_next		<= IRQ1;
				elsif(irq_i(1) = '1') then
					irq_1					<= '0';
					state_next		<= IRQ2;
				else
					irq_1		<= '0';
					irq_2		<= '0';
				end if;
		-- IRQ1 state -------------------------------------------
			when IRQ1 =>
				w_data				<= add_1;
				state_next		<= IRQ1_W;

			when IRQ1_W =>

				state_next		<= IDLE;
				if((not full and not irq_1) = '1') then
					wr			<= '1';
					irq_1		<= '1';
				end if;
		-- IRQ2 state -------------------------------------------
			when IRQ2 =>
				w_data				<= add_2;
				state_next		<= IRQ2_W;

			when IRQ2_W =>

				state_next		<= IDLE;
				if((not full and not irq_2) = '1') then
					wr			<= '1';
					irq_2		<= '1';
				end if;
		end case;
	end process;
...
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{IRQ output}
The output block is reading the data out of the FIFO and present them for the wishbone. It gets a read input from the wishbone, when the ARM7 wants to read data from the register. The main purpose of the block is to make sure that the wishbone read the write data, and it is only reading once from the FIFO.\\
A state diagram for the output block is shown below. In the IDLE state rd is set low, then et check if the wishbone wants to read, else it reset the read counter, if the wishbone wants to read, the IDLE state checks if it is the first time by checking the read counter, if it is the first time the rd is set high to get the next data from the FIFO, and the read counter is set to one.

		\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images/tb5_irq_output_state.png}
		\caption{State diagram for output}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
Here the states is defined plus the read counter.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
	--Types
	type state_type is	(
											IDLE,
											READ_O,
											RSET
											);
	--Signals
	signal state_reg		: state_type;
	signal state_next		: state_type;
	signal read_wb			: std_logic;
...
\end{lstlisting}
The lower bits in the data\_o is set to the data from the FIFO, the other bits is set to zero. In the process the next state is loaded.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL]
...
	data_o(Datawidth-1 downto AddrRange)	<= (others => '0');
	data_o(AddrRange-1 downto 0)					<= r_data;

Below the state actions is defined following the state diagram. The rd is set low in IDLE and the wishbone read is checked. In READ the read counter is set to one and rd is set high to read data out of the FIFO.

\paragraph{Wishbone interface}
In order to use the interrupt register in the system, is shall be implemented as a wishbone slave, with a wishbone interface, this is done in the code below. The error and retry bit i set to zero, the acknowledge bit i set then the strobe input and the cycle input is high. In the process a synchronous reset is made. If the reset is inactive, it checks if the strobe and cycle input is high and the write enable is low, the meaning is to check if the wishbone wants to read or write. This module is a read only so it is not reacting on a write statement. If the wishbone wants to read, the data output is set and a read to the output block is set high, when the wishbone determinates the read cycle the data output is set to zero and the read statement for the output block is set low again.

\subsubsection{Verification}
The verification of the IRQ register is made in a VHDL test bench, because there is currently no blocks with interrupt ability implemented. The verification test bench is shown below. The test is made by make four interrupts, this can be seen on the \textit{IRQ\_in} signal which has four pulses on the two signals. The address on \textit{add\_1} and \textit{add\_2} is written into the FIFO. The test bench also shows that the \textit{IRQ\_out} change after the first interrupt is assigned. After this four wishbone reads are made, by setting the cycle and the strobe input high, this give a acknowledge bit, and the \textit{Data\_out} is change to the first element in the FIFO, and the next read get the next data and further on. After the last wishbone read the FIFO is empty and the \textit{IRQ\_out} is set high again to indicate there is no interrupt.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
The test bench verify that the interrupt register is working with virtual signals in simulation. The switch block is to be change to have interrupt ability, and then it shall be implemented with the interrupt register and tested properly with communication and interrupt to the ARM7
