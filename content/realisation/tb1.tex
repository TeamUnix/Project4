\subsection{ARM to FPGA connector}
Connecting the FPGA board (in our case a Spartan6 board by Digilent and the Arm board from EA) can be done in different ways. The fastest way if the number of connections are relatively low, is usually with a bunch of wires between the two boards. But even though such a setup can be much more flexible, it can be very hard to error searching if something is not working (maybe because of a broken wire or a short circuit) and is also very sensitive to noise. Instead of the wires a PCB solution has been chosen, which will be designed to fit
