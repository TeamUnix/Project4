The EUDP\footnote{Embedded Unified Development Process} method is applied for this project. The contents of EUDP can be found on \url{http://www.eudp.net}. The method is focused on the work process for software and hardware, this work process will be used to solve the problems in this part of the project. The EUDP method consist of four phases, The perproject, launch phase, realisation phase and postproject. The first two phases was made in the project from 3rd semester\footnote{EPRO3}, the last two phases is made in the 4th semester project\footnote{EPRO4}. The EUDP material is included as appendices in this report. The complete list of EUDP phases and their content is available at \url{http://eudp.net/index.php/Documentation}\\
There is some predefined requirements for platforms and basic structure of every part in the project that needs to be fulfilled, these requirements may help in the problem solution.\\
The material taught in the different courses from 1st to 4th semester will be used as knowledge for developing the technical parts in this project.\\
