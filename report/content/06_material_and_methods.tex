\chapter{Material and methods}
The EUDP\footnote{Embedded Unified Development Process} method is applied for this project. The contents of EUDP can be found on \url{http://www.eudp.net}. The method focused on the work process for software and hardware, this work process will be used to solve the problems in this part of the project. The EUDP method consist of four phases, The pre-project, launch phase, realization phase and post-project. The first two phases were made in the 3rd semester project\footnote{EPRO3}, the last two phases is made in the 4th semester project\footnote{EPRO4}. The EUDP material is included as appendices in this report. The complete list of EUDP phases and their content is available at \url{http://eudp.net/index.php/Documentation}\\
This is the first time the EUDP method is used, the basic understanding of the process is gathered through the project, this means that the first part of each phase is not completely following the method.
There is some predefined requirements for platforms and basic structure of every part in the project that needs to be fulfilled, these requirements may help in the problem solution.\\
The material taught in the different courses from 1st to 4th semester will be used as knowledge for developing the technical parts in this project.\\
