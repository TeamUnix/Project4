The methods used in this project has been showed to be useful for developing software and hardware for the product. All the problems in the problem statement has been solved to a certain degree. It is definitely possible to realize the project from the parts that have been developed so far. As the first time use of the EUDP method the launch phase and the first three timeboxes has not been complete compared to the methods guidelines for each phase. The reason for this was missing understanding of the different phases and their content, a understanding that have been gathered through the project work on 3rd and 4th semester.
